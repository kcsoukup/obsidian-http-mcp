# Changelog

All notable changes to Obsidian HTTP MCP.

---

## [1.0.1] - 2025-11-06

### Added

- `get_file_info` tool - Get file metadata (size, modified timestamp)
- `create_directory` tool - Create vault directories with idempotent behavior

### Fixed

- Path validation in `get_file_info` - Rejects directory paths (trailing slash)
- Error handling in `directoryExists()` - Correctly propagates 401/500 errors
- Timestamp fallback in `getFileInfo()` - Returns empty string when header missing

### Development Notes

- 11 tools total (9 → 11)
- +290 lines across 10 files
- 3 bugs detected and fixed via code review
- 1h40 dev time

## [1.0.0] - 2025-11-04

### Added

- HTTP-native MCP server using `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`
- 9 core tools: list_dir, list_files, find_files, read_file, write_file, search, move_file, delete_file, delete_folder
- Soft delete with `.trash-http-mcp/` directory
- Fuzzy file search with 60s cache
- CLI with environment variable support

### Performance Improvements

- Search 1000 files: 50s → 2-3s (96% faster via batched parallel reads)
- Fuzzy matching 10k files: 500ms → 50ms (90% faster via filtered subset)
- Delete operations: Protected from API throttling (20 concurrent max)

### Security Hardening

- Path traversal protection with URL decoding validation
- ReDoS protection with 500 char query limit
- SECURITY.md with deployment checklist

### Code Quality

- TypeScript strict mode with typed interfaces (removed all `as any` casts)
- Batch processing utility for concurrent operations
- Single source of truth for version (package.json import)
- PORT validation (1-65535 range check)

### Development Notes

- +408 lines across 20 files
- 2h45 dev time

## [0.9.0] - 2025-11-02

### Added (Pre-release)

## Architecture Notes

**Problem Solved**: 150+ stdio-based Obsidian MCP servers fail with BrokenPipeError (Claude Code CLI bug #3071)

**Solution**: First HTTP-native MCP server for Obsidian using official SDK

**Flow**:

```text
Claude Code CLI → HTTP (POST /mcp) → Express + MCP SDK → Obsidian REST API (port 27123)
```

**Key Decisions**:

- Stateless pattern (new transport per request)
- Trailing slash requirement for directories (Obsidian API)
- Batch processing to prevent API throttling
- Soft delete by default for AI operation safety

**Critical Points for Devs**:

1. **Trailing slash REQUIRED**: Directories must end with `/` (e.g., `BUSINESS/`), files must not (e.g., `note.md`)
2. **Accept header**: MCP SDK requires `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream`
3. **Cross-platform**: WSL2 requires `0.0.0.0` binding, reinstall `node_modules` after platform switch
